= Installing protobuf for static / dynamic linking

== Prerequisites

* You have installed _cmake_ (version 3.10.2 or higher)
* You must have superuser privileges

Static linking is the recommended way to package OSI FMUs for sharing with others to be integrated in a co-simulation: They should have minimal external dependencies in order to ensure maximum portability.
For other use cases like first trials to get started with OSI, dynamic linking could be an option as well.

== Windows

Dynamic Linking (NOT RECOMMENDED)::

Since on Windows symbols are not exported per default, it can be kind of annoying to deal with this during _protobuf_ header generation (see for example https://groups.google.com/g/protobuf/c/PDR1bqRazts).
That is an important reason to use static linking.

Static Linking::

Static linking might require to manually build _protobuf_. 
It is important to notice that on Windows you can also specify how to link against the C runtime.
Basically, this can be set in CMake, e.g. https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY.html

Therefore, it could make sense to still dynamically link against the C Runtime when statically linking _protobuf_ / OSI.
(This is important e.g. when building shared libraries, since a static C runtime will create an isolated heap for your dll, which can lead to segfaults depending on what you expose on your public interfaces.)

The easiest way to achieve static linking on Windows without setting all the stuff manually in Cmake and building _protobuf_ is to actually **install static _protobuf_ with dynamic c-runtime with vcpkg**:

Install vcpkg as per the vcpkg documentation.
Create a new triplet file for the required combination of static library linking with dynamic runtime (usually needed for dynamic linking to still work):
Create a file named x64-windows-static-md.cmake in the triplets directory with the following content:

----
set(VCPKG_TARGET_ARCHITECTURE x64)
set(VCPKG_CRT_LINKAGE dynamic)
set(VCPKG_LIBRARY_LINKAGE static)
----

Now the protobuf libraries can be built automatically using:
----
vcpkg install --triplet=x64-windows-static-md protobuf
----

== Linux

Dynamic linking (NOT RECOMMENDED)::

As already mentioned, shared linking is possible on Linux, but NOT RECOMMENDED.
However, for dynamic linking install _protobuf_ (version 3.0.0 or higher) with apt: 
----
sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
----
In the CMakeLists of the OSI project, `LINK_WITH_SHARED_OSI` has to be enabled.

Static linking::

A common error here is to just install _protobuf_ with apt and link against it. 
This means that your OSI is build statically but still linking dynamically against _protobuf_.
Here, again either _protobuf_ has to build statically from source or some solution e.g. vcpkg needs to be utilized.
We recommend the following (as in the README of the OSI project):

Install _protobuf_ (version 3.0.0 or higher) from source with `CXXFLAGS="-fPIC"` to allow static linking of your OSI FMUs (replace <version> with preferred release):
----
wget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/<version>/protobuf-all-<version>.tar.gz
tar -xzf protobuf-all-<version>.tar.gz
cd protobuf-<version>/
./configure --disable-shared CXXFLAGS="-fPIC"
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
----
